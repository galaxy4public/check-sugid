%description
The check-sugid script scans the system for any binaries with extensive
privileges and prints the list out in a format compatible with the
post-transaction-actions Yum plugin, so it would be possible to define
rules for the detected binaries and these rules will be enforced on
package installations/updates.

The script could be used as a standalone tool, but the recomended way
is to call from the at-exit Yum plugin, so the check is performed each
time there is a change to the package set.

%install
rm -rf -- '%buildroot'
mkdir -p -m755 '%buildroot%_sbindir'
install -m700 -p '%_sourcedir/%name.script' '%buildroot%_sbindir/%name'

%files
%defattr(0600,root,root,0700)
%attr(0700,root,root) %_sbindir/%name
